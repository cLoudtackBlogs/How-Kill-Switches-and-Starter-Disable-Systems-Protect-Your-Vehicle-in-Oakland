                <h3>Risks of DIY Installation</h3>
                <p>
                    Self-installation carries several risks:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Accidental damage to vehicle electrical systems <br>Improper wire connections that could fail or cause electrical issues <br>Interference with vehicle computer systems or diagnostic capabilities <br>Voiding vehicle warranties if improperly installed <br>Less effective concealment, making the system easier for thieves to detect
                </p>
                <h2>Cost Considerations for Oakland Drivers</h2>
                <p>
                    The cost of kill switches and starter disable systems varies based on complexity and installation:

                <h3>Typical Price Ranges</h3>
                <p>
                    <b>Basic Kill Switches:</b> $50-150 installed
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Advanced Systems with Smartphone Control:</b> $300-500+ installed
                </p>
                <p>
                    For Oakland drivers, these costs should be weighed against:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Local insurance deductibles (typically $500-1,000) <br>Potential insurance discounts for having additional security <br>The value of your vehicle and its contents <br>The prevalence of theft in your specific neighborhood <br>Many Oakland drivers find that even basic systems provide excellent value relative to their cost.
                </p>
                <h2>Combining with Other Security Measures</h2>
                <p>

                </p>
                <h3>Complementary Security Features</h3>

                </p>
